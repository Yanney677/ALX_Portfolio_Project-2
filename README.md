## AMASS - Todo list App

### Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, individuals and teams often struggle to manage their tasks efficiently,
leading to disorganization, missed deadlines, and decreased productivity. The key challenge lies in
the lack of a centralized and intuitive system for task management. Existing solutions are either
overly complex, lacking essential features, or not easily accessible across devices, hindering users
from effectively organizing their tasks and maximizing their productivity.

### Objective(s)
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust Todo-list management system that enhances
task organization and productivity for individuals and teams. The key objectives include:

1. Efficient Task Management: Create a platform for users to easily create, organize, prioritize,
and manage their tasks in a streamlined manner.

2. User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface to ensure ease of use for
individuals with varying levels of technical proficiency.

3. Customization Options: Provide users with the ability to customize their Todo-lists according to
their preferences, including task categories, due dates, reminders, and tags.
